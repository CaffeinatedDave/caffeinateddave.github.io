      <h1>Your Ideal Codebase</h1>

      <p>
        Not too long ago I went through some job interview preperation. I was warned that one of the go-to questions of the interviewer was
        "What does good code look like?". The question didn't come up through the interview, but I'd put a fair bit of thought into my answer
        so thought I'd put it somewhere.
      </p>

      <h4>Definition of Good</h4>

      <p>
        One thing I really like about Agile (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/agile-same-thing-tim-creasey/">with a big A</a>) is that it
        has a concept called the "Definition of Done". What that means is despite the individuals on a team having different areas of focus
        (in practice, if not in theory) the team as a whole agrees when a particular task is "finished". For example: a developer might think a
        task is done when it leaves code review. A tester doesn't see it as finished until it has been signed off as working correctly. The product
        owner doesn't think it's finished until it's in production and adding value. The team therefore might decide that their Definition of Done
        means that code must meet all of the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Code reviewed</li>
          <li>Passed by QA</li>
          <li>In production</li>
          <li>Value realised</li>
        </ul>

        If any of those 4 steps aren't completed, the task isn't Done, and someone should still be engaged to looking at ticking the last boxes.
      </p>

      <p>
        With that in mind, a Definition of Good for code should be something that is universal, independant of language, environment, or even
        workflow
      </p>

      <h4>Working</h4>

      <p>
        The main indicator to any code quality: Does it work? If code doesn't work, or doesn't do what's expected of it, then it can't possibly be
        good. The most elegant code in the world that throws up an error on startup, or crashes when it's run isn't good code, it's broken.
      </p>

      <h4>Tested</h4>

      <p>
        Untested code is potentially dangerous code. If something hasn't been tested there's no way to know how it will work, or more likely how
        it will break. Not all testing has to be unit tests; integration, regression, and just general use is all useful in terms of testing.
      </p>

      <h4>Monitored</h4>

      <p>
        If code is executed on a server, and there's no way to tell if it works or not, does it really work at all? Having safe-guards in place
        that tell you when things break give you the peace of mind to know that it isn't actually broken (or your monitoring is broken, which is
        why you need monitoring on your monitoring....).
      </p>

      <h4>Understandable</h4>

      <p>
        Code that is easy to figure out what it's doing is easy to change for new requirements (though any new requirements that cause code change
        may reduce the levels of testing that). Being clearer also means it's easier for the unlucky engineer who's called out at 3am to figure
        out what caused those alarms.
      </p>

      <p>
        So that's my thoughts on what makes applications and code 'good'. It has to work (obviously). It has to be tested to ensure it will continue
        to work. It needs to be monitored so you can be sure it is still working. Finally, it needs to be understandable so it's easy to figure out what's
        stopping it from working if the monitoring ever goes off.
      </p>
