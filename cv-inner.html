        <h3>Personal Profile:</h3>
        <p>
          An experienced Software Engineer from both a B2B and B2C background looking to take the next step in my career with a move
          into line management. This is something which I've grown into enjoying both through my mentoring experience with newer team
          members and my volunteer work to introduce people into technology. As my career progresses I've found more enjoyment around
          building and preserving the culture of a team than I do about the programming language the team chooses to use, as well as
          being an enabler for people to get the most out of their own skills and strengths.
        </p>
        <p>
          Possess a wide skill set along with an ability and keenness to learn other languages as the need arises, and the ability to
          step back and look at a problem from different angles, often identifying future issues before they arise.

          Out of hours on call engineering and problem resolution - proven ability to take control whilst staying calm during
          an incident and identify the error whilst working with colleagues and providers located in different
          locations and timezones, working to fix or mitigate the problem quickly while providing updates to stakeholders as needed.

          ‘Captaining’ a team - ensuring team members work to the best of their abilities, despite troubles and difficulties
          both within and external to the team, whilst encouraging them to develop their skills further. Dealing with things
          from environmental problems such as missing team members, tight deadlines and new processes - all to increase team
          delivery, productivity and happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proven record of mentoring - Both inside and outside of my team, helping both junior colleagues get up to speed with our
          ways of working and setting goals; and experienced developers who want to take the next step in their careers and don't know how.
        </p>
        <p>
          Improving team and corporate culture - I represented a team of 60+ people at company “employee forums” ensuring
          company-wide issues like benefits, bonuses, policy changes and corporate decisions are understood and passed on to
          everyone. I am also a point of call for employees to speak to if they do not feel confident going to their
          line manager or Human Resources and am responsible for arranging internal events with a provided budget to
          improve morale, making the environment more than just a job, and the people here more of a team.

        <p>
          Experienced teacher -  As a volunteer for codeFirst:girls I've been able to teach complete beginners how to create
          their own site, including the use of version control systems. This carries over to work, where I'm able to explain to
          less technical team members how the products fit together, and where their new ideas can fit to get the desired results
          as painlessly for all sides as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Experience working from the ground up - going from an idea, to proof of concepts, to robust and production
          ready applications.

          <p>
            <strong>International Tribe:</strong><br/>
            A green-field project to go from nothing to a full-fledged Italian sportsbook and casino. I’ve been involved in
            development in all areas, back-end APIs, front-end single page applications, a fan-out push server, the event
            driven casino wallet, dealing with regulatory requirements via 3rd parties and performance testing. This role has
            also involved mentoring more junior members of the team in things like coding standards and best practises, as
            well as training up more experienced team members in a new language they hadn’t previously encountered. I’m
            often considered the “voice” of my teams, being the one who’ll challenge people on the team to deliver what was
            promised, and push back on unreasonable expectations from external sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to my development roles, I have several other responsibilities including:

            <strong>Out of Hours On-Call Engineer:</strong><br/>
            Relied upon to be able to fix any issues that come up, even outside of my own specific area of expertise.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Mentor:</strong><br/>
            Both formally and informally, helping people from my own and other tribes to grow, offering them insights into
            my own experience and processes, introducing them to people who can help them grow in different areas, and
            generally acting as a sounding board for issues they might have. More formally this has grown to include people
            on the apprentice scheme along with their course mentor from Sheffield Hallam University.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Employee Forum Representative:</strong><br/>
            As part of Sky Betting and Gaming growing beyond a single office where messages were passed on through
            “conversations in corridors”, they decided to create an Employee Forum where each tribe in the business could
            be represented, bringing issues to a central conversation, and being able to translate these messages back to
            their own teams. This has involved bringing issues from the tribe (both direct and from the grapevine) to be
            discussed and resolutions fed back to the wider group.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sheffield Culture Champion:</strong><br/>
            Born out of an office-wide frustration with being a much smaller satellite office without a lot of the perks the
            central office enjoyed, myself and a few others set out to make sure that we weren’t left out in future. This
            involved liaising with Leeds colleagues to find out what was planned, organising deliveries to the office to
            correspond with what was happening elsewhere, organising hackathon events and socials for the tribe and
            generally helping to improve overall office morale.

          <p>Job Titles: ​Junior Developer, Developer, Senior Developer, Software Engineer, Team Lead, Consultant</p>
          <p>
            Throughout most of my time at OpenBet I was involved with APIs in one way or another, starting with OXi - a business critical
            product that dozens of clients and millions of customers would use to interact with customer accounts (login, funds transfers)
            and bets (staking, history). When on the product teams, I worked to ensure that they worked across 20+ customers, switching
            functionality based largely on legacy configuration and dependency injection for newer functionality. On customer teams, I
            worked to make sure that the functionality worked as required and was performant for the environments and expected load they
            were needed on, as well as making recommendations for where new products should be bought in and offering detail for how they
            should be used by both 2nd and 3rd parties, while avoiding unnecessary changes to the code where alternatives were available,
            but perhaps not as obvious to external engineers.
