        <h3>Personal Profile:</h3>
        <p>
          An experienced Engineering Leader with both a B2B and B2C background currently enjoying more line management and people
          focused roles. This is something which I've grown into doing both through my mentoring experience with newer team members
          and my volunteer work to introduce people from other backgrounds into technology, in addition to my formal leadership roles.
          As my career progresses I've found more fulfilment in building and preserving the culture of a team than I do with the
          programming language and development routes the team chooses to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Able to promote and incorporate new principles across my teams to encourage cohesion, honestly manage stakeholders who hold
          multiple competing priorities, balance the technical needs of an engineering team and their codebase with the business needs
          of product and marketing teams, hire suitable new team members at all levels from graduates seeking their first job to
          skilled senior contractors to come and fill an immediate, urgent, need; all while coaching my individual team members to meet
          their own personal development goals.

        <h4>Other Skills:</h4>
        <p>
          ‘Captaining’ a team - prior to formal line management, I worked to ensure team members work to the best of their abilities,
          despite troubles and difficulties both within and external to the team, whilst encouraging them to develop their skills
          further. Dealing with things from environmental problems such as missing team members, tight deadlines and new processes
           - all to increase team delivery, productivity and happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proven record of mentoring - Both inside and outside of my team and company, helping both junior colleagues get up to speed with our
          ways of working and setting goals, and experienced developers who want to take the next step in their careers and don't know how.
        </p>
        <p>
          Improving team and corporate culture - I represented a team of 60+ people at company “employee forums” ensuring company-wide issues
          like benefits, bonuses, policy changes and corporate decisions are understood and passed on to everyone. I am also a point of call
          for employees to speak to if they do not feel confident going to their line manager or Human Resources and am responsible for
          arranging internal events with a provided budget to improve morale, making the environment more than just a job, and the people here
          more of a team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Out of hours on call engineering, incident commander and problem resolution - proven ability to take control whilst staying
          calm during an incident and identify the error whilst working with colleagues and providers located in different locations
          and timezones, working to fix or mitigate the problem quickly while providing updates to stakeholders as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Experienced teacher -  As a volunteer for codeFirst:Girls I was able to teach complete beginners how to create
          their own websites, including the use of version control systems. This carries over to work, where I'm able to explain to
          less technical colleagues how the products fit together, and where their new ideas can fit to get the desired results
          as painlessly for all sides as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Experience working from the ground up - going from an idea, to proof of concepts, to robust and production ready applications,
          as well as maintaining and migrating legacy systems as required.

            Responsible for 7 squads, across 3 domains, to deliver against their respective roadmaps. This role has involved making
            decisions around team structure, working with stakeholders around the business and ensuring their needs are met, while
            balancing the needs and satisfaction of internal team members. My focus in this role has always been in the 6-12 month

            liaising with stakeholders from Product, Engineering, Security, Marketing and other squads, prioritizing tech
            roadmaps for a mix of product, tech and regulatory requirements (Sarbanes Oxley and PCI DSS).<br/>

            A green-field project to go from nothing to a full-fledged Italian sportsbook and casino. I’ve been involved in
            development in all areas, back-end APIs, front-end single page applications, a fan-out push server, the event
            driven casino wallet, regulatory requirements via 3rd parties and performance testing. I was often considered
            the “voice” of my teams, being the one who’ll challenge people on the team to deliver what was promised, and push
            back on unreasonable expectations from external sources.

            In addition to the above roles, I have been entrusted with several other responsibilities including:

            <strong>Out of Hours On-Call Engineer:</strong><br/>
            Relied upon to be able to fix any issues that come up, even outside of my own specific area of expertise.

          <p>
            <strong>Mentor:</strong><br/>
            Both formally and informally, helping people from my own and other tribes to grow, offering them insights into
            my own experience and processes, introducing them to people who can help them grow in different areas, and
            generally acting as a sounding board for issues they might have. More formally this has grown to include people
            on the apprentice scheme along with their course mentor from Sheffield Hallam University.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Employee Forum Representative:</strong><br/>
            As part of Sky Betting and Gaming growing beyond a single office where messages were passed on through
            “conversations in corridors”, they decided to create an Employee Forum where each tribe in the business could
            be represented, bringing issues to a central conversation, and being able to translate these messages back to
            their own teams. This has involved bringing issues from the tribe (both direct and from the grapevine) to be
            discussed and resolutions fed back to the wider group.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sheffield Culture Champion:</strong><br/>
            Born out of an office-wide frustration with being a much smaller satellite office without a lot of the perks the
            central office enjoyed, myself and a few others set out to make sure that we weren’t left out in future. This
            involved liaising with Leeds colleagues to find out what was planned, organising deliveries to the office to
            correspond with what was happening elsewhere, organising hackathon events and socials for the tribe and
            generally helping to improve overall office morale.

          <p>
            Throughout most of my time at OpenBet I was involved with APIs in one way or another, starting with OXi - a business critical
            product that dozens of clients and millions of customers would use to interact with customer accounts (login, funds transfers)
            and bets (staking, history). When on the product teams, I worked to ensure these products worked across 20+ customers, switching
            functionality based largely on legacy configuration and dependency injection for newer functionality. On customer teams, I
            worked to make sure that the functionality worked as required and was performant for the environments and expected load they
            were needed on, as well as making recommendations for where new products should be bought in and offering detail for how they
            should be used by both 2nd and 3rd parties, while avoiding unnecessary changes to the code where alternatives were available,
            but perhaps not as obvious to external engineers.
