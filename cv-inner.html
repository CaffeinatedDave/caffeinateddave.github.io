        <h3>Personal Profile:</h3>
        <p>I am a hard working, dependable and determined individual who strives to not only meet, but surpass,
          expectations. Whilst confident to use what I already know, I also enjoy learning new technologies and
          languages if they’re a better fit for the task at hand. With a proven history of developing battle-tested,
          supportable solutions, I'm comfortable putting forwards ideas and discussing them with a team to get to
          the eventual ideal solution.
        </p>
        <p>Throughout my career I’ve found myself gradually moving towards a more people-focused role, taking
          on mentoring of new starters or colleagues who have transfered into the team, being trusted to
          represent a group of people with differing views for the overall greater good, and helping to encourage
          a positive working culture. In doing so I have come to realise that I really enjoy helping people to
          get the most out of their skills and strengths both individually and as part of the wider team.

            <strong>International Tribe:</strong><br/>
            A green-field project to go from nothing to a full-fledged Italian sportsbook and casino. I’ve been involved in
            development in all areas, back-end APIs, front-end single page applications, a fan-out push server, the event
            driven casino wallet, dealing with regulatory requirements via 3rd parties and performance testing. This role has
            also involved mentoring more junior members of the team in things like coding standards and best practises, as
            well as training up more experienced team members in a new language they hadn’t previously encountered. I’m
            often considered the “voice” of my teams, being the one who’ll challenge people on the team to deliver what was
            promised, and push back on unreasonable expectations from external sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to my development roles, I have several other hats:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Mentor:</strong><br/>
            Both formally and informally, helping people from my own and other tribes to grow, offering them insights into
            my own experience and processes, introducing them to people who can help them grow in different areas, and
            generally acting as a sounding board for issues they might have. More formally this has grown to include people
            on the apprentice scheme along with their course mentor from Sheffield Hallam University.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Employee Forum Representative:</strong><br/>
            As part of Sky Betting and Gaming growing beyond a single office where messages were passed on through
            “conversations in corridors”, they decided to create an Employee Forum where each tribe in the business could
            be represented, bringing issues to a central conversation, and being able to translate these messages back to
            their own teams. This has involved bringing issues from the tribe (both direct and from the grapevine) to be
            discussed and resolutions fed back to the wider group.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sheffield Culture Champion:</strong><br/>
            Born out of an office-wide frustration with being a much smaller satellite office without a lot of the perks the
            central office enjoyed, myself and a few others set out to make sure that we weren’t left out in future. This
            involved liaising with Leeds colleagues to find out what was planned, organising deliveries to the office to
            correspond with what was happening elsewhere, organising hackathon events and socials for the tribe and
            generally helping to improve overall office morale.

            <strong>OpenBet, London; Montreal; Copenhagen</strong> - <em>August 2009 to May 2015</em>
          </h4>
          <p>Job Titles: ​Junior Developer, Developer, Senior Developer, Software Engineer, Team Lead, Consultant</p>
          <p>
            Throughout most of my time at OpenBet I was involved with APIs in one way or another, starting with OXi - the
            main way that 3rd parties and certain customers could interact with customer accounts (login, funds transfers)
            and bets (staking, history). When on the product teams, I worked to ensure that they worked across 20+
            customers, switching functionality based largely on legacy configuration and dependency injection for newer
            functionality. On customer teams, I worked to make sure that the functionality worked as required and was
            performant for the environments and expected load they were needed on, as well as making recommendations for
            where new products should be bought in and offering detail for how they should be used by both 2nd and 3rd
            parties, while avoiding unnecessary changes to the code where alternatives were available, but perhaps not as
            obvious to external engineers.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also had a brief stint as a Team Lead for a greenfield piece of work, unfortunately cut short as priorities shifted;
            the project was massively reduced in scope and I was required to help another client get over the final hurdle to
            push their new sportsbook live.

              <li>Shell scripting to aid in tasks such as creating realistic data, mass updates of data, freeing up DB semaphores
                and other repetitive tasks that could be simplified.</li>
