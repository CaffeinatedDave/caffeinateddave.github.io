        <h3><span>Personal Profile:</span></h3>
        <p>
          An experienced Engineering Leader with both a B2B and B2C development background who is now focused solely on people focused roles and the problems faced within. A firm believer in both radical candor and conscientious rule-breaking, both of which are always intended for the greater good of the individuals, my team and the business.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is something which I've grown into doing both through my initial mentoring experiences and my volunteer work to introduce people from other backgrounds into technology, in addition to formal leadership roles. As my career has progressed I've found more fulfilment in building and preserving the culture of a team than I do with the programming language and development routes the team chooses to use, though my background ensures that I know enough to be able to develop and mentor engineers through technical problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Able to promote and incorporate new principles across my teams to encourage cohesion, honestly manage stakeholders who hold multiple competing priorities, balance the technical needs of an engineering team and their codebase with the business needs of product and marketing teams, hire suitable new team members at all levels from graduates seeking their first job to skilled senior contractors to come and fill an immediate, urgent, need; all while coaching my individual team members to meet their own personal development goals.

        <h3><span>Skills Summary:</span></h3>
        <p>
          Stakeholder management - Being able to change my language and approach to be able to communicate effectively across different parts of the business; be that engineers, architects, product owners, marketing and operations teams; has been key to my effectiveness in my role. Honesty and trust across these conversations means that when it comes to having difficult conversations, or having to tell someone they can't have a feature they want, they know it comes from a genuine effort to have understood and accomodate them into the bigger picture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proven record of mentoring - Both inside and outside of my team and company, helping junior engineers get into technology, or up to speed with our ways of working and setting goals, experienced developers who want to take the next step in their careers and don't know how, and other roles who want to move into a line management role.
        </p>
        <p>
          Improving team and corporate culture - I represented a team of 60+ people at company “employee forums” ensuring company-wide issues like benefits, bonuses, policy changes and corporate decisions are understood and passed on to everyone. I was also a point of call for employees to speak to if they did not feel confident going to their line manager or Human Resources and took responsiblity for arranging internal events with a provided budget to improve morale, making the environment more than just a job, and the people here more of a team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Out of hours on call engineering, incident commander and problem resolution - proven ability to take control whilst staying calm during an incident and identify the error whilst working with colleagues and providers located in different locations and timezones, working to fix or mitigate the problem quickly while providing updates to stakeholders as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Supplier Negotiations - identifying, negotiating, and eventually onboarding suppliers (or not) to fill a technical or resource need within the teams. Maintaining a relationship with suppliers to ensure productive working relationships going forward, and having tough conversations where needed if they fall short.
        </p>
        <p>
          Experienced teacher -  As a volunteer for codeFirst:Girls and codeUp Sheffield I was able to teach complete beginners how to create their own websites, including the use of version control systems. This carries over to work, where I'm able to explain to less technical stakeholders how our products fit together, and where their new ideas can fit to get the desired results as painlessly for all sides as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Experience working from the ground up - going from an idea, to proof of concepts, to robust and production ready applications, as well as maintaining and migrating legacy systems as required.

            <strong>Customer Tribe - Engineering Manager (Feb 2021 - current)</strong><br/>
            Responsible for the line management of both principal and lead engineers across mulitple squads and multiple domains, to deliver against their respective roadmaps. This role has involved making decisions around team structure, working with stakeholders from around the business and ensuring their needs are met, while balancing the needs and satisfaction of internal team members. My focus in this role has always been in the 6-12 month timeline, looking ahead of what the teams themselves are currently working on, and setting them up for success.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goals in this role have been threefold:
            <ul>
              <li>Task. Delivering Value - ensuring that my teams have what they need in terms of people and processes to do their jobs to a high standard.</li>
              <li>Team. Building Culture - building a team of teams amongst the leads and principals, so they can work together and make the overall tribe a great place to work.</li>
              <li>Individuals. Growing people - Ensuring that personal goals are relevant, achieveable and (most importantly) supported.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Gaming Next Gen Promotions - Principal/Lead Engineer (Jan 2019 - Jan 2021):</strong><br/>
            Leading a team of 6-8 other engineers to build new functionality and maintain what we already have. Involved in liaising with stakeholders from Product, Engineering, Security, Marketing and other squads, prioritizing tech roadmaps for a mix of product, tech and regulatory requirements (Sarbanes Oxley and PCI DSS).
          </p>
          <p>
            Owned and managed several key projects including migrating from kafka 0.11 -> 2.0 with 0 data loss and upgrading from internal manual processes to fully automated solutions.<br/>

          <p>
            <strong>International Tribe - ​Software Engineer; Senior Software Engineer (May 2015 - Dec 2019):</strong><br/>
            A green-field project to go from nothing to a full-fledged Italian sportsbook and casino. I’ve been involved in development in all areas, back-end APIs, front-end single page applications, a fan-out push server, the event driven casino wallet, regulatory requirements via 3rd parties and performance testing. I was often considered the “voice” of my teams, being the one who’ll challenge people on the team to deliver what was promised, and push back on unreasonable expectations from external sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the above roles, I have been entrusted with several other responsibilities including:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Out of Hours On-Call Engineer / Incident Commander:</strong><br/>
            Relied upon to be able to fix any issues that come up, even outside of my own specific area of expertise.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Employee Forum Representative:</strong><br/>
            As part of Sky Betting and Gaming growing beyond a single office where messages were passed on through “conversations in corridors”, they decided to create an Employee Forum where each tribe in the business could be represented, bringing issues to a central conversation, and being able to translate these messages back to their own teams. This has involved bringing issues from the tribe (both direct and from the grapevine) to be discussed and resolutions fed back to the wider group.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sheffield Culture Champion:</strong><br/>
            Born out of an office-wide frustration with being a much smaller satellite office without a lot of the perks the central office enjoyed, I set out to make sure that we weren’t left out in future. This involved liaising with Leeds colleagues to find out what was planned, organising deliveries to the office to correspond with what was happening elsewhere, organising hackathon events and socials for the tribe and generally helping to improve overall office morale.

          <p>Job Titles: ​Junior Developer, Developer, Senior Developer, Software Engineer, Team Lead, Consultant</p>
          <p>
            Throughout most of my time at OpenBet I was involved with APIs in one way or another, starting with OXi - a business critical product that dozens of clients and millions of customers would use to interact with customer accounts (login, funds transfers) and bets (staking, history, cashout). When on the product teams, I worked to ensure these products worked across 20+ customers, switching functionality based largely on legacy configuration and dependency injection for newer functionality. On customer teams, I worked to make sure that the functionality worked as required and was performant for the environments and expected load they were needed on, as well as making recommendations for where new products should be bought in and offering detail for how they should be used by both 2nd and 3rd parties, while avoiding unnecessary changes to the code where alternatives were available, but perhaps not as obvious to external engineers.
